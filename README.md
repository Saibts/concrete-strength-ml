# Concrete Strength ML

This project builds and evaluates a machine learning model to predict the compressive strength of concrete from its mix proportions and curing age. It uses a Random Forest regressor trained on the classic concrete compressive strength dataset (cement, slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, and age).
